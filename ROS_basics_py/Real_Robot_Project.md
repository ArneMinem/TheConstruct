# Real Robot Project

## BULLSHIT

In Topics Quiz we use the same robot with the same scanner. There the scanner is explained as going from 0 to 720 from left to right.

The 0 is on the right of the robot and 720 on the left. The middle is 360.

**HOWEVER, in the real robot, the scanner goes from 0 to 720 from back to back.**

This means that 0 is at the back right of the robot, 360 in front of it and 720 at the back left. Thus right is 180 and left is 540.

As there is no explaination of this in the real project and as the real project is the follow up of the topics quiz, I would expect the scanner to be the same!
